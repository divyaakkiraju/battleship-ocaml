Battleship, inspired by the classic board game.

This is a game of Battleship, inspired by the classic board game, Battleship. In this version, a player opposes a computer opponent. The player starts the game by setting up four ships on their 8x8 board. Once the player has strategically placed their boats on the board, the game against the computer opponent will begin. The player starts by guessing a coordinate where they believe the opponent board has a boat placed to try to "hit" the boat. If the player is successful in guessing a coordinate where a boat resides, they can guess again until they "miss." Once the player has missed, the computer will guess against the player until they "miss." This continues until either the player or the computer guesses every coordinate on the opposing board that contains a boat. 

This project is written in OCaml.
