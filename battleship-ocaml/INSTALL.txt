First, open a terminal which supports OCAML.

There is an OPAM package that needs to be installed to play this game. 
Start by updating opam with the following line:

  $ opam update

This command may take some time to complete, during which there will be no output. 
This especially happens on WSL1, where I've seen it take 10+ minutes.

If it afterwards prompts you to upgrade already-installed packages 
(which it very likely will), do so with the following line:

  $ opam upgrade

If that tells you "Everything is as up-to-date as possible [...] Nothing to do", 
with a lot of output in place of that "...", then don't worry: everything is fine. 

Finally install ANSITerminal:

  $ opam install ANSITerminal

Next, in the terminal navigate to the correct directory that has the zip file. 

  $ cd <name of zip file>

Finally to start the game use the following command:

  $ make play
